# SIMIO-continuum: from SIMulatIons to Observations
SIMIO-continuum is a collection of codes designed to help you compare your radiative transfer images with existing ALMA observations. Please check the [documentation](https://simio-continuum.readthedocs.io) and www.nicolaskurtovic.com/simio for a full description of the package.

# Get Started

This git-hub repository contains the codes to run SIMIO-continuum, but it does not include the example "Solar System to HD163296" project, and it does not contain the templates either. You can download the templates from www.nicolaskurtovic.com/simio/templates, and the example project can be downloaded by clicking on the following section.

You can also download the latest SIMIO-continuum in a ``tar.gz`` by clicking on this link: [simio_v1.2.tar.gz](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/1f05e4a74ef74a929237/) (13.2 MB).

Alternatively, you can download the latest SIMIO-continuum in a ``tar.gz`` pre-loaded with the project and template needed to complete the [tutorial 1](https://simio-continuum.readthedocs.io) of the [documentation](https://simio-continuum.readthedocs.io). Click on this link to download it: [simio_preloaded_v1.2.tar.gz](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/64882e1a5fd441c3ad8b/) (387.3 MB). 



# Example: Solar System to HD163296

How would the Solar System have looked if it was located where the HD163296 system is, and it had been observed by ALMA as part of the DSHARP project?

Click here to download this example project: [SolarS_HD163296.tar.gz](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/23c92e46e69c40e185f1/) (163.6 MB). After downloading it, untar it in the **projects** folder, such that the directories have the following order: /path_to_SIMIO/SIMIO/projects/SolarS_HD163296. 
The template for this project is the DSHARP observation of HD163296, which you can download from this [link](https://www.nicolaskurtovic.com/simio/templates). After downloading it, untar it in the **templates** folder, such that the directories have the following order: /path_to_SIMIO/SIMIO/templates/HD163296. 

Follow the [tutorial 1](https://simio-continuum.readthedocs.io/index.html#document-tutorials/tutorial_1) to go step by step from model to synthetic observation.
